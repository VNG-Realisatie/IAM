| Identity Federation | An identity federation is a group of computing or network providers that agree to operate using standard protocols and trust agreements. In a Single Sign-On (SSO) scenario, identity federation occurs when an Identity Provider (IdP) and Service Provider (SP) agree to communicate via a specific, standard protocol. The enterprise user will log into the application using their credentials from the enterprise rather than creating new, specific credentials within the application. By using one set of credentials, users need to manage only one credential, credential issues (such as password resets) can be managed in one location, and applications can rely on the appropriate enterprise systems (such as the HR system) to be the source of truth for a user&#39;s status and affiliation.Identity federations can take several forms. In academia, multilateral federations, where a trusted third party manages the metadata of multiple IdPs and SPs, are fairly common. This article focuses, however, on the enterprise use case where bilateral federation arrangements, where the agreements are one-to-one between an IdP and an SP, are the most common form of identity federation in use today. | [Federation in the Enterprise](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/62/){:target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”} |

| Identity Hub or Repository | The place where users can store their encrypted identity-related information. An identity hub can be anywhere – on the edge, on the cloud, or on your own server. Its purpose is to store personal data. Some implementations may allow other entities to access the identity hub of the user if the user specifically grants such access. You can think of an identity hub as the individual&#39;s personal data store. | [A Peek into the Future of Decentralized Identity](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/51/){:target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”} |
| Identity Information Authority (IIA){:target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”} | This represents one or more data sources used by the IDM as the basis for the master set of principal/subject identity records. Each IIA may supply a subset of records and a subset of attributes. Sometimes the IIA is distinguished from the Identity Information Provider or IIP. We use IIA to include the service that actually provides the information as well as the root authority. This corresponds to Identity Information Source in ISO/IEC 24760-2 and Identity Sources in Internet2. | [IAM Reference Architecture](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/76/){:target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”} |
| Identity Management (IDM){:target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”} | A set of policies, procedures, technology, and other resources for maintaining identity information.

| Identity Proofing | accruing evidence to support &quot;who this is.&quot; Identity proofing is the last, but not the least, important part of this admin-time section. This is the process of collecting and verifying information about a person for the purpose of providing an account or a corresponding credential. This is typically performed before an account is created or the credential is issued, or a special privilege is granted. | [Introduction to Identity - Part 1: Admin-time (v2)](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/27/){:target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”} |
| Identity Provider (IdP){:target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”} | An Identity Provider (IdP) performs a service that sends information about a user to an application. This information is typically held in a user store, so an identity provider will often take that information and transform it to be able to be passed to the service providers, AKA apps. The OASIS organization, which is responsible for the SAML specifications, defines an IdP as &quot;A kind of SP that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for principals and provides principal authentication to other SPs within a federation, such as with web browser profiles.&quot; | [Federation in the Enterprise](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/62/), [Authentication and Authorization](https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/78/){:target=”_blank” rel=”noopener”} |
